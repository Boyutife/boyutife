### 👋 About Me

Hi, I'm Bolu — a passionate software engineer in transition 🚀  
Currently focused on becoming a full-stack developer.  
My journey so far:

- 💻 I enjoy writing JavaScript (it's my first language — sorry, English 😄).
- ⚛️ React is my go-to frontend framework — I love its ecosystem and component-based approach.
- 🛠️ I'm currently deepening my React knowledge by building projects. After that, I plan to focus on working with APIs (I've used fetch() in a few projects already), then move on to learning Node.js for backend development.
- 🗃️ I also plan to use MongoDB for managing data as I build full-stack applications.

I'm committed to staying focused, avoiding distractions, and always learning.  
Open to internships, collaborations, and anything that gives real-world experience!

Let’s build something amazing together. ✨
